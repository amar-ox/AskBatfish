## I just have a question
Please don't file an issue to ask a question. 
You'll get faster results by contacting the authors at `amaroxmo <at> gmail <dot> com`.

## Reporting issues and suggesting enhancements

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report, and will thank you for it!

Check that our issue database doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

When reporting issues, always include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and
applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a gist (https://gist.github.com).
Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can
replace those parts with "REDACTED").

## Quick contribution tips and guidelines

This section gives the experienced contributor some tips and guidelines.

### Pull requests are always welcome

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it.
We are always thrilled to receive pull requests. We do our best to process them quickly. 

### Conventions

Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a feature branch:

- If it's a bug fix branch, name it XXXX-something where XXXX is the number of
    the issue.
- If it's a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce
    your intentions, and name it XXXX-something where XXXX is the number of the
    issue.

Pull request descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference
to all the issues that they address.

Commit messages must start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars)
written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory
text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the
suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Post
a comment after pushing. New commits show up in the pull request automatically,
but the reviewers are notified only when you comment.

Pull requests must be cleanly rebased on top of master without multiple branches
mixed into the PR.

**Git tip**: If your PR no longer merges cleanly, use `rebase main` in your
feature branch to update your pull request rather than `merge main`.

Before you make a pull request, squash your commits into logical units of work
using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. A logical unit of work is a consistent
set of patches that should be reviewed together: for example, upgrading the
version of a vendored dependency and taking advantage of its now available new
feature constitute two separate units of work. Implementing a new function and
calling it in another file constitute a single logical unit of work. The very
high majority of submissions should have a single commit, so if in doubt: squash
down to one.

Include an issue reference like `Closes #XXXX` or `Fixes #XXXX` in the pull request
description that close an issue. Including references automatically closes the issue
on a merge.

## Community guidelines

We want to keep the community awesome, growing and collaborative. We need
your help to keep it that way. To help with this we've come up with some general
guidelines for the community as a whole:

* Be nice: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members:
  no regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like
  nice people way better than mean ones!

* Encourage diversity and participation: Make everyone in our community feel
  welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their
  contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in
  our community.

* Keep it legal: Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that
  you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break
  the law.

* Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and
  avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond
  to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Please
  consider this before you update. Also remember that nobody likes spam.

* Don't send email to the maintainers: There's no need to send email to the
  maintainers to ask them to investigate an issue or to take a look at a
  pull request. Instead of sending an email, GitHub mentions should be
  used to ping maintainers to review a pull request, a proposal or an
  issue.

### Guideline violations — 3 strikes method

The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we
do need a fair way to deal with people who are making our community suck.

1. First occurrence: We'll give you a friendly, but public reminder that the
   behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.

2. Second occurrence: We will send you a private message with a warning that
   any additional violations will result in removal from the community.

3. Third occurrence: Depending on the violation, we may need to delete or ban
   your account.
